lLyrics
===============

lLyrics is a plugin for [Rhythmbox](http://projects.gnome.org/rhythmbox/), which displays lyrics for the current playing song in the sidebar.

It is intended as a replacement of the built-in lyrics plugin of Rhythmbox with more features, better UI integration and more lyrics engines.

It is also possible to retrieve lyrics from the built-in Rhythmbox lyrics plugin, but this is not recommended since it has some bugs and may cause instabilities.




Requirements
---------------

The 'master' branch supports Rhythmbox 3.0 and above. **It is incompatible with older Rhythmbox 2.xx versions!**

To get the plugin for Rhythmbox 2.xx, change to branch 'RB2'! It provides the last version compatible with Rhythmbox 2.xx, but please note, that it will quite certainly not be updated or developed any further.

To install lLyrics from source you will need the package gettext.

#### Dependencies ####

lLyrics can be run without the need of any additional packages, but it is recommended to install the python module **"chardet"** for better handling of different encodings.
